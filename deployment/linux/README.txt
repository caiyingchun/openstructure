HOW TO USE THE BUNDLE SCRIPTS:

1. Checkout a copy of the OpenStructure repository.
2. Move to the <OpenStructure folder>/deployment/linux folder and start the create_bundle.py script using python
3. In <OpenStructure> you'll find a tar.gz file. That's the bundle!
4. If the process stops without completing, run the reset_repository.py script or delete the <OpenStructure Folder> and restart from scratch
