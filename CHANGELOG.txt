Changes in Release 1.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The compoundslib now features InChI and InChIKeys (machine readable InChI
    hash)
  * Names of compounds are also stored in the compoundslib now

Changes in Release 1.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Feasibility check set to off by default, atoms in compounds are now
    connected by the Builder irrespective of the distance between them
  * Speed improvement for bracketed within selections up to a factor of 20
  * refactored and streamlined the conop interface. The builder classes
    have been replaced by processors (HeuristicProcessor, RuleBasedProcessor)

Changes In Release 1.3.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * fix context menu/main menu for newer Qt versions 
  * CreateEntityFromView remembers chemical type (BZDNG-430)
  * fix gfx.PrimList.SetLineWidth
  * Fix remote=true for MMCIF loader (BZDNG-449)
  * made CreateViewFromAtoms more flexible (BZDNG-408)

Changes In Release 1.3.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fixed atom ordering in the GetFrameFromEntity() function in the 
    structure_analysis.py module.
  * Fix atom indices generated by CoordGroup::Filter()
  * small tweaks to lDDT output
  * small tweaks to molck
  * Repaired bio unit parsing from mmCIF file/ PDBizing bio units, before
    chains with different transformations were ignored
  * use new remote loader written in Python to work around crash on Mountain 
    Lion

Changes In Release 1.3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Export missing default argument for AligmentHandle.ToString
  * Automatically attach entity view in SequenceFromChain
  * Export GetMatchingBackboneViews to Python
  * Fix compilation with boost 1.33.1
  * Allow renumbering of single chain

Changes In Release 1.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Scene background can now be set to a gradient or an image
  * Better Handling of HSV colors
  * Table: direct access to columns tab['x'] is also available as tab.x
  * Table: Export to ConTeXt and HTML tables
  * Table: Barplot interface
  * The BLAST binding supports newer versions of BLAST
  * Bindings for CAD score
  * Update directory layout of OST to be more conformant with the site-package
    system of Python: Instead of storing the modules in lib{64}/ost/ost, they
    are now in lib{64}/python{{VERSION}}/site-packages/ost
  * Added molck, the molecular checker. A small command-line tool to clean PDB 
    files, e.g. remove atoms with zero occupancy, "virtual atoms", hydrogens 
    etc.

Changes In Release 1.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * PDBWriter: Prevent writing of out-of-bounds atom coordinates.

Changes in Release 1.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Fixed loop indentation in the PDBize function for bio units, leading to
    exponential running time/ memory consumption. This problem only affected a
    fraction of PDB entries.

Changes in Release 1.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Use RPATH for linux bundles. No longer requires LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set
    for chemdict_tool and lddt [BZDNG-385]
  * "install command line tools" also symlinks lddt, and chemdict_tool
    [BZDNG-386]
  * Fixed broken the_hammer.py example [BZDNG-387]
  * MacOS X: Make sure to use python2.6, not python as pyexec [BZDNG-388]
  * Fix example directory path for MacOS X bundle [BZDNG-389]
  * PDBWriter: Insert newline after END [BZDNG-391]
  * Added missing documentation for a few AlignmentHandle methods
  * Workaround for naccess which was failing when directory contains dots.
  * Fixed superposition dialog for unnamed chains
  * Fixed byte-swapping issue for DCD trajectories
  * Fixed FFT panel update after switching data in main viewer
  * Added missing pdbx_struct_assembly.id export
  * lDDT: Updated default angle and bond tolerance parameters from 8 stddev to 12 
    stddev.

Changes in Release 1.2 (since 1.1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * added mmCIF parser to enable loading of mmCIF files. The following categories
   are currently understood:
   atom_site, entity, entity_poly, citation, citation_author, exptl, refine,
   pdbx_struct_assembly, pdbx_struct_assembly_gen, pdbx_struct_oper_list,
   struct, struct_conf, struct_sheet_range, pdbx_database_PDB_obs_spr,
   struct_ref, struct_ref_seq, struct_ref_seq_dif

 * trajectory analysis support

 * better intergration with numpy

 * added Smith-Waterman local align and Needleman-Wunsch global align algorithms

 * static linking of C++ executables

 * support for building OST library with no gfx, gui, info libraries. This leads
   to a compact application bundle that can easily be deployed

 * work around compiler bugs in gcc-4.1 enabling compilation with CentOS 5.5's
   default compiler and libraries

 * introducing the new table class, supporting all kinds of analyses on tabular
   data, including plotting and statistical analyses.

 * added stereochemical plausibility checks and support for multiple references
   to lDDT

 * new superposition dialog in DNG
