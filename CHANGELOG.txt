Changes in Release 1.2.2

  * Fixed loop indentation in the PDBize function for bio units, leading to
    exponential running time/ memory consumption. This problem only affected a
    fraction of PDB entries.

Changes in Release 1.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Use RPATH for linux bundles. No longer requires LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set for
    chemdict_tool and lddt [BZDNG-385]
  * "install command line tools" also symlinks lddt, and chemdict_tool [BZDNG-386]
  * Fixed broken the_hammer.py example [BZDNG-387]
  * MacOS X: Make sure to use python2.6, not python as pyexec [BZDNG-388]
  * Fix example directory path for MacOS X bundle [BZDNG-389]
  * PDBWriter: Insert newline after END [BZDNG-391]
  * Added missing documentation for a few AlignmentHandle methods
  * Workaround for naccess which was failing when directory contains dots.
  * Fixed superposition dialog for unnamed chains
  * Fixed byte-swapping issue for DCD trajectories
  * Fixed FFT panel update after switching data in main viewer
  * Added missing pdbx_struct_assembly.id export
  * lDDT: Updated default angle and bond tolerance parameters from 8 stddev to 12 
    stddev.

Changes in Release 1.2 (since 1.1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * added mmCIF parser to enable loading of mmCIF files. The following categories
   are currently understood:
   atom_site, entity, entity_poly, citation, citation_author, exptl, refine,
   pdbx_struct_assembly, pdbx_struct_assembly_gen, pdbx_struct_oper_list,
   struct, struct_conf, struct_sheet_range, pdbx_database_PDB_obs_spr,
   struct_ref, struct_ref_seq, struct_ref_seq_dif

 * trajectory analysis support

 * better intergration with numpy

 * added Smith-Waterman local align and Needleman-Wunsch global align algorithms

 * static linking of C++ executables

 * support for building OST library with no gfx, gui, info libraries. This leads
   to a compact application bundle that can easily be deployed

 * work around compiler bugs in gcc-4.1 enabling compilation with CentOS 5.5's
   default compiler and libraries

 * introducing the new table class, supporting all kinds of analyses on tabular
   data, including plotting and statistical analyses.

 * added stereochemical plausibility checks and support for multiple references
   to lDDT

 * new superposition dialog in DNG
